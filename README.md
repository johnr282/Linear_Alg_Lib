# Linear_Alg_Lib
This project is a fully templated linear algebra library written in C++. I'm writing it mostly as a learning experience to understand more about all the optimization and data storage decisions required to efficiently work with matrices, as well as the implementations of various numerical algorithms. Currently, the library provides a `MathVector` class, which represents an $n$-dimensional mathematical vector, and a `DenseMatrix` class, which is designed to store a $n \times m$ matrix whose elements are mostly nonzero.
